		<h1>Cats</h1>
		<p>Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second most
			popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and
			diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally recommended for the
			well-being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.</p>
		<h2>Zero to Four Weeks</h2>
		<p>It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing) directly
			nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kittenâ€™s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is
			progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the
			kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight
			appropriately include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>too many other siblings are competing for mon's milk</li>
			<li>gastrointestinal disease</li>
			<li>environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Four Weeks to One Year</h2>
		<p>Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks after birth.
			According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips">ASPCA</a>, kittens at
			this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If
			your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat
			food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and
			wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements. You should always
			consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.</p>

		<h2>One Year to Seven Years</h2>
		<p>This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. At this age, their level of
			activity decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is <b>not</b> recommended to leave food out for the
			cats
			all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking throughout the
			day. This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.</p>

		<h2>Seven Years and More</h2>
		<p>Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. Cats at this
			age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing packaged
			foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and <b>not</b> just a
			category (such as fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality
			proteins.</p>
